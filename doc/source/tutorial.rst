Hashdist 0.1 tutorial
========================

Status
------

The goal of the 0.1 release is to gather input that can steer further
development. Please speak up on the mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hashdist

Hashdist is only tested on Linux and Python 2.7. Python 2.6 may work.
Mac OS X status is unknown, Windows will definitely not work.

The goals of Hashdist
---------------------

Current solutions for software distribution fall short for some
user-bases.  One such example is scientific software, in particular on
HPC clusters.  Another example is Python packaging for developers who
need to live on bleeding edge across multiple platforms.

The idea of Hashdist is to solve the problem of software distribution
through a declarative approach: You always specify a full distribution
that you want in a set of configuration files, then do a full rebuild
(from source) in order for changes to be reflected. However, builds
are cached under an associated hash reflecting the entire build
environment, so that a "full rebuild" is often very fast. Thus,
"uninstall" is simply removing the package from the configuration and
do a rebuild, no explicit code is needed to implement the "uninstall"
feature. (Also, the "build" step could potentially mean downloading a
binary package over the net, though thatâ€™s out of scope currently.)

See the :ref:`FAQ` for further details on goals.

Getting Hashdist
----------------

::

    git clone git://github.com/hashdist/hashdist.git stable

There is currently no installer; this tutorial will assume
that the directory is put in ``PYTHONPATH`` and the ``bin``-subdirectory
in ``PATH``.

Once downloaded, execute::

    $ hdist inithome

This will set up ``~/.hdistconfig``, which by default configures hashdist to use storage in ``~/.hdist`` which is also created::

    $ ls ~/.hdist
    bld  opt  src

``bld`` contains temporary builds, ``src`` will cache downloaded
source code, while ``opt`` contains software that has been built.

Core vs. front-end
------------------

The core part of Hashdist, living in ``hashdist.core``,
has a JSON-oriented API and will in time hopefully have many
front-ends, one for each type of userbase.

Because a back-end by itself is boring, Hashdist currently provides
a simple front-end in ``hashdist.recipes``. This is where our tutorial
starts, but please keep in mind that the front-end is only one out of
many possible ways to expose the core functionality.

An analogy may be that ``hashdist.core`` is like the GNU Make program,
while ``hashdist.recipes`` are utility snippets one can use in
Makefiles. In the 0.1 release, the core is 3500 LOC while the recipes
part is less than 400 LOC. The core is also much better documented
and tested presently.

Example: Building HDF5 from sources
-----------------------------------

We want to build HDF5 together with its two dependencies, szip and
zlib.  We fetch one as a tarball and one using git::

    $ hdist fetch http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.2.6/zlib-1.2.6.tar.gz
    <snip curl output>
    tar.gz:HtaA96RDXGi2QGcJuwiHQrVit67BpE0Llh6UzzCv-q8

    $ hdist fetchgit git://github.com/erdc/szip.git master
    <snip git output>
    git:87863577a4656d5414b0d598c91fed1dd227f74a

The last line in each case is the *key* of the sources. This is used
both to verify the contents on extraction, and as a
globally unique ID for the sources.  Fetched sources are stored under
``~/.hdist/src``, indexed by the key.

In general tarballs are faster to unpack, but if one is tracking a
project in development, perhaps on ones own filesystem, it is
wasteful to download a full tarball for every new build, so git is
also supported (hopefully more VCSes in time).

Pre-fetching the sources is not necesarry if one already knows
the key, so we skip the download of HDF5 itself at this point, and move to
the creation of a script ``mystack.py`` containing::

    import hashdist.recipes as hr
    
    unix = hr.NonhashedUnix()
    gcc = hr.NonhashedGCCStack()
    
    zlib = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('zlib', '1.2.6',
                                   'http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.2.6/zlib-1.2.6.tar.gz',
                                   'tar.gz:ISNeCFUub+ugnqXo11CAWzORxi+4HHGiNcAETceophs',
                                   unix=unix, gcc=gcc)
    
    szip = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('szip', '2.1',
                                   'git://github.com/erdc/szip.git',
                                   'git:87863577a4656d5414b0d598c91fed1dd227f74a',
                                   configure_flags=['--with-pic'],
                                   unix=unix, gcc=gcc)
    
    hdf5 = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('hdf5', '1.8.10',
                                   'http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src/hdf5-1.8.10.tar.bz2',
                                   'tar.bz2:+m5rN7eXbtrIYHMrh8UDcOO+ujrnhNBfFvKYwDOkWkQ',
                                   configure_flags=['--with-szlib', '--with-pic'],
                                   zlib=zlib, szip=szip, unix=unix, gcc=gcc)

    profile = hr.Profile([hdf5, szip, zlib])
    
    hr.cli.stack_script_cli(profile)

(Yes, this is a simplistic example. Just take our word for the fact that
Hashdist will easily let you use your own shell scripts to do more
complicated builds. See also discussion below.)

Then run the script to figure out the current status::

    $ python mystack.py -s
    Status:

    profile/n/D3UJ..                                                       [needs build]
      hdf5/1.8.10/im0c..                                                   [needs build]

          virtual:gcc-stack/host,virtual:unix/host                         (see above)
        virtual:unix/host                                                  (see above)
      szip/2.1/BT1Q..,zlib/1.2.6/TI7T..                                    (see above)
    
    Build needed

Then kick off the build::

    $ python mystack.py target
    ...
    [zlib] Unpacking sources to /home/dagss/.hdist/bld/zlib/1.2.6/osu6
    [zlib] Building zlib/1.2.6/osu6.., follow log with:

    [zlib] running ['./configure', '--prefix=/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6']
    [zlib] success
    ...
    Created "target" -> "/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-"
    

If you want more information there's the ``-v`` flag, in which case you'd
get::

    $ python mystack.py -v local
    ...

    ...
    Created "target" -> "/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-"

At the end of the build we are left with
``~/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q``, ``~/.hdist/zlib/1.2.6/osu6`` and
``~/.hdist/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA``, e.g.,::

    $ find ~/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.so
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.so.1.2.6
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.so.1
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.a
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/include
    /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/include/zlib.h
    ...

Also, there is ``~/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-``, containing symlinks
to all three packages::

    $ ls -l ~/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-/bin
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss 50 Dec 21 16:19 h5diff -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA/bin/h5diff
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss 50 Dec 21 16:19 h5dump -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA/bin/h5dump
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss 52 Dec 21 16:19 h5import -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA/bin/h5import
    ...
    
    $ ls -l ~/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-/lib
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss   54 Dec 21 16:19 libhdf5.so -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA/lib/libhdf5.so
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss   49 Dec 21 16:19 libsz.so -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/lib/libsz.so
    ...

Finally, since we added ``local`` as a script argument, a ``local`` symlink
is emitted in the current directory for our convenience::

    $ ls -l local
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 dagss dagss 37 Dec 21 16:19 local -> /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/profile/n/-3e-

.. note::

   If the hashes don't look exactly like the above, it would be
   because this tutorial is out-dated. The hashes should be the same
   between different systems. The 4-character hashes are abbreviated
   versions of the full ID (and become longer on collisions).

   While the "version" string is used in a plain fashion here, it is
   encouraged in more complicated setting to put more information in
   it, such as ``zlib/1.2.6-amd64-icc-avx/CesW``.

   Finally, in this example the GCC version does not affect the hash,
   which is a big mistake. See the section on "Using software from the
   host system" below for the full plan.

Using the software
------------------

To actually use the results, you can simply put ``local/bin`` in your
``$PATH``, and/or point to ``local/lib`` and ``local/include`` when
you build software. The plan is to provide a tool so that you can do
``source  <(hdist env profile-name)`` from a Bash session, but this is
not implemented yet.

More complicated software, such as Python, will be discussed in another
section below.

Note that the binaries and libraries have all been linked with an "RPATH",
meaning that no messing with ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` is needed. Note how
paths beneath ``/home/dagss/.hdist`` features below::

    $ ldd local/bin/h5ls
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff4bb58000)
        libhdf5.so.7 => /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/3ysA/lib/libhdf5.so.7 (0x00007f0347e30000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0347a4c000)
        libsz.so.2 => /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/lib/libsz.so.2 (0x00007f0347838000)
        libz.so.1 => /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007f034761b000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007f0347320000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f03482ed000)

    $ ldd local/lib/libhdf5.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffe44dd000)
        libsz.so.2 => /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/lib/libsz.so.2 (0x00007fb5bfeec000)
        libz.so.1 => /home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.6/osu6/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00007fb5bfcce000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007fb5bf9ae000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb5bf5f1000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb5c05bd000)

Again, this will be further discussed below.

Branching your software stack
-----------------------------

In the example above, we did in fact use an outdated version of *zlib*,
so let's update to a newer one::

    zlib = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('zlib', '1.2.7',
                                   'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/libpng/zlib/1.2.7/zlib-1.2.7.tar.gz',
                                   'tar.gz:+pychjjvuMuO9eTdVFPkVXUeHFMLFZXu1Gbhvpt+JsU',
                                   unix=unix, gcc=gcc)

(I ran ``hdist fetch`` to retrieve the updated hash, but you can just copy it.)
Then rerun (or read the section below on `ccache` to save some time)::

    (master) ~/code/hashdist $ python examples/mystack.py local
    profile/n/4z+N..                                                       [needs build]
      hdf5/1.8.10/W+IA..                                                   [needs build]
        virtual:gcc-stack/host (=gcc-stack/host/CT2D..)                    [ok]
          virtual:hdist-cli/r0 (=hdist-cli/r0/eJbh..)                      [ok]
        szip/2.1/BT1Q..                                                    [ok]
          virtual:unix/host (=unix/host/R5KL..)                            [ok]
            virtual:hdist-cli/r0                                           (see above)
          virtual:gcc-stack/host                                           (see above)
        zlib/1.2.7/whcr..                                                  [needs build]
          virtual:gcc-stack/host,virtual:unix/host                         (see above)
        virtual:unix/host                                                  (see above)
      szip/2.1/BT1Q..,zlib/1.2.7/whcr..                                    (see above)
    
    Build needed
    [zlib] Unpacking sources to /home/dagss/.hdist/bld/zlib/1.2.7/whcr
    [zlib] Building zlib/1.2.7/whcr.., follow log with:
    [zlib]   tail -f /home/dagss/.hdist/bld/zlib/1.2.7/whcr/build.log
    ...

If and only if the build succeeds, the ``target`` link is atomically
updated.

The existing build results (a.k.a. *artifacts*) from the previous
run are left in place. The trailing hashes ensures that even if
there is not a version bump, but just a slightly changed ``CFLAGS``,
the artifacts can happily coexist on disk.

**NOW COMES THE MAIN POINT OF HASHDIST**: If you now change
``mystack.py`` back to how it was before, with *zlib* version 1.2.6,
the rebuild will be nearly instant since the artifacts are already
there. So, if you simply put ``mystack.py`` under version
control, you are able to very quickly jump between different software
stacks, go back and forward in time, and so on.

This can also transparently handle some features found in package
management systems. To uninstall HDF5, but keep zlib and szip around,
it is sufficient to change the line::

    profile = hr.Profile([hdf5, szip, zlib])

to::

    profile = hr.Profile([szip, zlib])

Again, a "rebuild" is instant.


The future
----------

That concludes the high-level tour of the current
functionality. Further development will have two facets:

**I) Building the car:** The ``mystack.py`` script is not an adequate
solution. The point is that it shows how the Hashdist API can be used
by something else that parses a higher-level, more user-friendly
description of the desired software stack.

For instance, to build (yet another) scientific Python source
distribution, one could continue the script for a couple of hundred
lines to get something very similar to Sage, but with faster
upgrades. Then add a configuration file that is parsed and affects the
build flags, automatic fetching of metadata from PyPI, and so on.

Note that Hashdist does not provide anything in the direction of a
**package management system**: A system that looks at package metadata
and automatically resolve dependencies etc. (with a package system you
would only need to explicitly mention HDF5 above, not zlib and szip).
However, we believe that one or more decent systems for installing
packages can be built on top of Hashdist.

**II) Improving the engine:** Additional features will also be
needed in the core engine. The most important ones are
garbage collection (remove unused build results after some time)
and improved sandboxing (discussed below).
Distribution of resulting builds as binary packages is also
worthy of consideration, though probably out of scope for current
funding.


Advanced topics
---------------

ccache
''''''

A nice feature of "functional software building" is how easy it
can be to change how the software is built. To use *ccache*, and
significantly speed up similar rebuilds, it is currently sufficient
with::

    ccache = hr.CCache(gcc=gcc, unix=unix)
    
    zlib = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('zlib', '1.2.7',
                                   ...,
                                   ccache=ccache, unix=unix, gcc=gcc)

Then `ccache` will know to insert itself in front of the real `gcc`
in the path, and will bind to exactly the `gcc` that is provided
(if there are more than one, see below).

Using software from host system
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Some dependencies for the build does not need to enter the hash.  We
are willing to trust that the ``cp`` tool is stable enough that one
does not want different artifacts compiled with different versions of
``cp``. Therefore we use ``hr.NonhashedUnix()`` to get the basic Unix
tools from the host without having them enter the hash. For more
information see the documentation of "virtual artifacts" in
:mod:`hashdist.core.build_store`. (There is still a way out and change
the hashes if a catastrophic bug is in fact discovered in ``cp``; it
is just manually curated rather than automatic.)

However, using ``gcc = hr.NonhashedGCCStack()`` as the compiler is
highly questionable, since the GCC version that is used is very
important, and one wants to be able to trigger different builds with
different versions of GCC.

One solution is to set up a full build of gcc, including download of
sources etc. However, this is often not what one wants; what one wants
is to use software from the host while making that software enter the
hash. There are two ways of attacking this. First, it is in fact
very easy to integrate with existing software distributions, so in
version 0.2 one will be able to do::

    gcc = hr.DebianPackage('gcc', 'deb:oCaEGwBOSSqxE6HaLpL9nIMCjxmFHh0itPoPa18bWX0')

or::

    icc = hr.EnvironmentModules('intel/11.0', 'modules:GfOiMlTioNUZXElKQKJDqcyvPSAoewy0qBplPBCFhbI')

and then proceed to pass these as arguments to packages built by
Hashdist.  In the former case, a Debian package provides checksums
that can be used to fetch the digest very quickly. In the latter case
some hashing of files on the filesystem would be needed.  We expect
this to be the preferred method since it is so explicit and in fact
easy to implement.

However, if this doesn't work for some users,
one can always do something to the effect of
::

    gcc = hr.HostSoftware(['/usr/bin/gcc', '/usr/bin/as', ...],
                          'host:qatIOWcGNM7Aw+3QM32YqB7X35W-SJyl4f1Tyu+9U20')

where the listed files are hashed (by contents or name+date) and brought
into the build environment.

But wait, I don't want all those rebuilds!
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Having to rebuild the entire software stack every time GCC is updated in
response to a ``sudo apt-get upgrade`` is of course a major pain!
However, it is not necesarry. The following cannot be tried today, but
facilitating it is a core feature of the design so far::

    gcc_4_6_2 = hr.DebianPackage('gcc', 'deb:oCaEGwBOSSqxE6HaLpL9nIMCjxmFHh0itPoPa18bWX0')
    hdf = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('hdf', ..., gcc=gcc_4_6_2)
    python = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('python', ..., gcc=gcc_4_6_2)

    gcc_4_6_3 = hr.DebianPackage('gcc', 'deb:qwvHTcGiksl+Wu3BALaBvjuXXXLO45ftmjqU3Uhlhww')
    pytables = hr.ConfigureMakeInstall('pytables', ..., gcc=gcc_4_6_3, hdf=hdf, python=python)

The key point to realize here is that it *does not have to be possible
to build a package* if it is already built; one just needs to know its
hash.

Thus one creates a "paper trail" ("hash trail"?) of exactly what has
happened: First HDF5 and Python was compiled, then the system GCC was
upgraded, then PyTables was compiled.  Of course, if one tries to pass
``gcc=gcc_4_6_2`` instead to PyTables one will get an error (unless
the same PyTables source code was in fact built at a time when the
older GCC was installed, and hasn't been garbage collected since).

User-facing frontends to Hashdist can simply take "metadata
snapshots" of the host system every time a new package is installed, so
that the correct paper trail of host dependencies is present.

Note how easy it now would be to request that Python *should* in fact
be rebuilt with the newest GCC. This also creates the foundation for
binary redistributable artifacts, since it is not a requirement that
the used compiler has ever been present on the current host system.
In fact, something to this effect is possible::

    pkg = hr.JustUseTheArtifactDontThinkAboutIt("python/2.7.0-compiled-in-oslo/EXBjBU87Z9GuIGFaeCnvwR4Xrlasn-7+IaAgsrox8dc")

In short: Keep in mind that in the build dependency DAG, a sub-tree
can be left out if the root is already built.

Python and details of profile construction
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To explain how Hashdist software profiles can work with Python, it's worth
describing exactly how *virtualenv* works: It makes a sub-directory
where most of the Python files (``lib`` contents etc.) are symlinked,
but the ``python`` binary itself is *copied*.
The key is that when Python starts, it will use the real path of its
binary to try to resolve where its libraries can be found, before
checking ``/usr/lib``.

The profile creation in Hashdist is *not* hard-coded to a set of symlinks;
in fact each artifact can specify
arbitrary actions that should happen on install. Here is
``~/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/W+IA/artifact.json`` from my system::

    {
      "install" : {
        "commands" : [
          ["hdist", "create-links",  "--key=install/parameters/links", "artifact.json"]
        ], 
        "parameters" : {
          "links" : [
            {
              "action" : "symlink", 
              "prefix" : "$ARTIFACT", 
              "select" : "$ARTIFACT/*/**/*", 
              "target" : "$PROFILE"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }

So it is already the case that you can make a Python build which, when
its artifact is linked up to a profile, uses virtualenv to do the job
instead of (only) creating symlinks. Thus one can get a dedicated ``lib/python2.7``
in each profile symlinking to the wanted set of Python packages,
avoiding the need to set ``$PYTHONPATH``.

We may change this scheme a bit, because keeping hundreds of copies of
Python around, ~8 MB each, can be prohibitive (and if profile creation
is not dirt cheap then much of the point disappears). What we can do
instead is to compile a 10-line C program which hard-codes the path to
the real Python and passes it to ``exec``, thus fooling the Python
binary into thinking its real location is the 1KB launcher program.

The build sandbox
'''''''''''''''''

Even if we, unlike Nix/Nixpkgs, do not insist on 100% reproducible
environments down to `libc` and Linux kernel, it is still important
that PyTables doesn't link against the host system's HDF5 library
*unless explicitly requested* (mainly because it becomes impossible
to automatically trigger a rebuild of PyTables with a newer system HDF5
library).

The **current** sandbox merely sets up the environment variables from scratch,
in particular ``PATH``. The following is from ``~/.hdist/hdf5/.../build.log.gz``::

  {'ARTIFACT': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/hdf5/1.8.10/W+IA',
   'BUILD': '/home/dagss/.hdist/bld/hdf5/1.8.10/W+IA',
   'HDIST_CFLAGS': '-I/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/include -I/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.7/whcr/include',
   'HDIST_LDFLAGS': '-L/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/lib -Wl,-R,/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q/lib -L/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.7/whcr/lib -Wl,-R,/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.7/whcr/lib',
   'HDIST_VIRTUALS': 'virtual:gcc-stack/host=gcc-stack/host/CT2DnIT3D7UfuftXhqmbAFjMHhlTztIPq2MyVdiw-kg;virtual:hdist-cli/r0=hdist-cli/r0/eJbh7T9+3ewnn7+Q+XAGTxQAYv9fJKqZbmAi9+ZPDrU;virtual:unix/host=unix/host/R5KLiZOFsP9ApHyQR0kTDPY3Alj0PA7IjU1nXGweU9Y',
   'PATH': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/gcc-stack/host/CT2D/bin:/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/unix/host/R5KL/bin',
   'gcc': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/gcc-stack/host/CT2D',
   'gcc_id': 'gcc-stack/host/CT2DnIT3D7UfuftXhqmbAFjMHhlTztIPq2MyVdiw-kg',
   'szip': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/szip/2.1/BT1Q',
   'szip_id': 'szip/2.1/BT1Q4++E8+Ag3pbJ0DIK6uGuaAPGLJkrT39ZFAJ7rUw',
   'unix': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/unix/host/R5KL',
   'unix_id': 'unix/host/R5KLiZOFsP9ApHyQR0kTDPY3Alj0PA7IjU1nXGweU9Y',
   'zlib': '/home/dagss/.hdist/opt/zlib/1.2.7/whcr',
   'zlib_id': 'zlib/1.2.7/whcrogNznCYtbkBucGztK+HLZgaumucwZZKk5HrTW+A'}

This is the *full* set of environment variables during the build.  Pay
particular attention to the ``PATH`` variable; by having the
`gcc-stack` and `unix` artifacts symlink to a subset of what is
available in `/bin/` and `/usr/bin` we ensure that, e.g., one gets an
error if a Fortran compiler is used  (presumably inadvertedly, since
no Fortran compiler has been passed in to the build).

The way library linking is controlled is by setting compiler flags.
This does requires cooperation of each individual build system; however
it is usually straightforward enough. For autoconf projects one can
simply set ``LDFLAGS`` and ``CFLAGS``.

.. note::

   The current RPATH (see the ``-Wl,-R,...`` flags above) is absolute,
   making it impossible to move the artifact store. Few if any build
   systems supports relative RPATHs smoothly, however it would be possible
   to use the ``patchelf`` tool after the build to make binaries
   relocateable. (There are other issues with relocateability though,
   such as the full path being hardcoded into ``*.pyc`` and ``*.pyo``;
   they must be fixed on a case by case basis.)

The **future** sandbox will likely take some additional measures.
One possibility is chroot, but that is heavy-handed and often
requires administrative privileges, so we want to avoid that. Instead,
we want to make use of ``LD_PRELOAD`` to override functions
in ``libc``. This has much of the same effect, the process is
jailed (unless it sends its own signals directly to the kernel).
We can use this to whitelist what files on the host system
is available, in particular under ``/usr/lib`` and ``/usr/include``.

What should happen if a process accesses a non-whitelisted file?

 * **Option A**: This happens if the build was incorrectly
   set up (not enough ``--without-foo`` options passed to
   ``./configure``, or ``LDFLAGS`` not propagated to every linker
   command).  Therefore one should raise an error and let the
   developer fix the build rules. This makes the jail an optional
   development tool.

 * **Option B**: Have the jail lie and say that the file is not
   present. This will make things simpler for a lot of build systems
   as auto-detection of libraries can be left on, however it does
   mean that the jail must always be present for a correct build.

We will likely implement both modes and let the user decide.

Further reading
---------------

To get the whole picture it is recommended to also read
through :mod:`hashdist.core.build_store` and look at some of the
``build.json`` files (which can be found in the root of each
produced artifact).

The "recipes" system is undocumented, but ``hashdist/recipes/ccache.py``
and ``hashdist/recipes/configure_make_install.py`` are good starting
points.
